    \item On-site internship under this government-sponsored enterprise.
    \item Project 1: Developed data visualizations (Heatmaps, Bar charts, 3D) using Python libraries Bokeh and Pandas. The visualization system is used for housing loan risk analysis where feature recognition and correlation analysis are essential part of the algorithms and model development.
    \item Project 2: Developed a Django web application that hosts the visuals of the data models. The web application is designed for direct and interactive access to the data by the users. The visualization is configurable by customizing axises and Django caching is deployed for high performance.
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Audience1st}{January 2019-May 2019}{Software Developer}{}
    \item Part of an academic project where groups of students are assigned to small businesses or startups to work on some of their features of their web application. Most of the projects were done in Rails. Involved in many Software Engineer practices, such as continuous integration and user stories.
